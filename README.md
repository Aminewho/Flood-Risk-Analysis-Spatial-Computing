Flood Prediction Model: Start with building a basic deep learning model using TensorFlow or PyTorch to predict flood risk. You can use your elevation data and weather data for training.

Data Ingestion: Use GeoPandas and Rasterio to load and process geospatial data (e.g., elevation, weather data).

Flood Risk Calculation: Based on the model predictions, calculate flood zones using thresholds (e.g., predicted rainfall, elevation thresholds, etc

optimize your setup for CPU usage. For better compatibility with libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch, ensure they use the CPU effectively. 

python3 -m pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

GeoPandas: To handle geospatial data.
Matplotlib: For basic visualizations (e.g., flood maps).
Plotly: For interactive visualizations (e.g., interactive flood zone maps).
