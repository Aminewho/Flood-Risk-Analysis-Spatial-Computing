### Dataset Description and Classification

The dataset described in the text is used for flood detection, with training and validation data derived from two primary sources: **permanent water data** and **flood event data**. Below is a breakdown of the dataset and its classification methodology:

---

### **1. Permanent Water Data**
#### **Source:**
- **JRC Surface Water Dataset**: This dataset provides monthly surface water observations at a 30m resolution from Landsat satellite imagery (1984–2018).

#### **Classification:**
- **Water Pixels (True Positive):** 
  - Pixels identified as "permanent" water observed at both the start and end of the dataset.
  - Used as accurate examples of water.
- **Non-Water Pixels (True Negative):**
  - Pixels never observed as water.
- **Ignored Pixels:**
  - Seasonal or ephemeral water pixels due to lower accuracy in detecting transient water classes.

#### **Accuracy:**
- Permanent water class has less than 1% error in commission and omission.
- Other water classes are less reliable due to factors like cloud cover and sedimentation.

### **2. Flood Event Data**
#### **Source:**
- **Global Database of Flood Event Areas (Dartmouth Flood Observatory)**:
  - Flood events covered by Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery.
  - Additional events in Cambodia and Spain were selected to increase geographic diversity.

#### **Preprocessing:**
- **Data Extraction:**
  - Google Earth Engine was used to filter and intersect Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images for flood events.
- **Flood Maps:**
  - **Sentinel-1 Flood Map**: Created using a dynamic threshold on the VH band with methods like Otsu’s thresholding.
  - **Sentinel-2 Flood Map**: Generated using indices like:
    - **NDVI**: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index.
    - **MNDWI**: Modified Normalized Difference Water Index.
    - Additional steps included cloud detection and shadow masking.

#### **Chip Creation and Sampling:**
- Imagery divided into 512 x 512 non-overlapping chips.
- Chips with major cloud cover were excluded.
- **Hand-Labeled Chips:**
  - 446 chips were stratified and hand-labeled by analysts for validation.
  - Stratification: 75% of chips had >0.02 sq. km of water; 25% had ≤0.02 sq. km.
- **Non-Hand-Labeled Chips:**
  - 4,385 chips exported with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 flood classifications for weakly supervised training.

### **3. Hand Labeling Process**
- **Analyst Tools:**
  - GUI in Google Earth Engine with access to Sentinel-1 VH bands, Sentinel-2 composites, and reference classifications.
- **Labeling Actions:**
  - Mark water areas to add or remove.
  - Identify uncertain areas as “no data.”

### **4. Dataset Split**
- **Bolivia as Test Data:**
  - All hand-labeled data from Bolivia is reserved for testing, ensuring evaluation on unseen flood events.
  - Sentinel-2 classifications for Bolivia are excluded from training and validation.
- **Other Data:**
  - Hand-labeled data split into **60% training**, **20% validation**, and **20% testing**.
  - Non-hand-labeled data used for weakly supervised training.

### **Summary**
The dataset is designed to:
1. Reliably identify permanent water (JRC data) while ignoring transient water.
2. Leverage Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 flood imagery to create detailed flood maps.
3. Combine hand-labeled and weakly supervised data for robust model training, validation, and testing.
